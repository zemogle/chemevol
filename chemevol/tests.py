'''
Chemevol - Python package to read in a star formation history file,
input galaxy parameters and run a chemical evolution model to determine the evolution
of gas, metals and dust in galaxies.

Running this script will produce a results data file (filename.dat) with file name given by user

The code is based on Morgan & Edmunds 2003 (MNRAS, 343, 427)
and described in detail in Rowlands et al 2014 (MNRAS, 441, 1040).

If you use this code, please do cite the above papers.
